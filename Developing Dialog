2021.7.16:
  Roughly complete news request module. Left some question: 1. UI is not good. 2. Pictures will change while scroll.
    2021.7.19:
      The reason may be that setting picture is another thread, so the cache function of recyclerView does not work (guess).
      
2021.7.19:
  Add Covid-19 news getting module (no UI).

2021.7.20:
